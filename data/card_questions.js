export const card_answers = {
  question_1: {
    text: "Artists sometimes use colour to evoke a particular mood or atmosphere.\
 Find the palettes and paints that Impressionist artists used in Singtel Special Exhibition Gallery B."
  },

  question_2: {
    text: "Many Impressionists painted everyday scenes of the Parisian middle class in caf√©s,\
 cabarets and parks. Instead of formal poses and staged settings, they often captured images that were candid.\
 Consider how this compares to the way you see and document the world you live in."
  },

  question_3: {
    text: "Impressionists often arranged paintings in three sections: foreground‚Äîthe part of the painting that\
 appears closest to the viewer; middle ground‚Äîthe part of the picture between the foreground and background;\
 and background‚Äîthe part of the picture that appears furthest away. Artists use composition to lend perspective or create a sense of balance and harmony."
  },

  question_4: {
    text: "Many Impressionist artists took their inspiration from the unique surroundings they lived and worked in.\
 While some were interested in capturing modern city life, a few artists were averse to the intense pace\
 of modern society and‚Äîwith the ease of mobility provided by new railroads‚Äîescaped to the countryside to paint."
  },

  question_5: {
    text: "Impressionist artists studied and sought to recreate the way light bounces off the faces of dancers,\
 cathedrals and water surfaces. Sometimes they painted the same scene several times, but in different light.\
 They were also attuned to the latest developments in colour and optical theory and created shadows by mixing\
 complementary colours instead of using black. "
  },

  question_6: {
    text: "Impressionist artists often painted realistic scenes of modern life en plein air, or outdoors.\
 They created blurred outlines or vague forms in their paintings to portray a fleeting moment and\
 capture a sense of ambiguity typical of the modern experience."
  },

  question_7: {
    text: "The size of an artwork often depends on a few factors such as the choice of subject matter,\
 where it will be presented, and even how much money the artist has to purchase paints and canvasses.\
 Some Impressionists were so poor that they would reuse an old canvas by painting another work on top of an existing one."
  },

  question_8: {
    text: "Impressionist artists often juxtapose warm and cool colours, such as orange and blue, side by side.\
 Complementary colours ‚Äúvibrate‚Äù when placed next to each other, creating the visual effect of appearing brighter, or more intense."
  },

  question_9: {
    text: "Quickly applied brushstrokes give the impression of movement and spontaneity.\
 Instead of rendering realistic details in photographic quality, Impressionists artists often made their brushwork visible,\
 relying on the viewer‚Äôs eye to visually blend the individual marks and colours and perceive the essence of the whole scene."
  },

  question_10: {
    text: "Photography inspired artists to capture immediate snapshots or moments in time.\
 The invention of synthetic, readymade paints that came in portable tubes allowed them to work spontaneously,\
 whether outdoors or in a studio. Consider the ways new technology affect your ideas of time, space and memory, and the things you create."
